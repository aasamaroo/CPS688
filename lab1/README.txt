Assignment: Lab 1

Questions: 

1. a) Computing Sum of n Numbers

i) Natural size metric would be anything between 2, and 10 inputs

ii) The basic operation of this algorithm is to add numbers

iii) The basic operation count will not change for inputs of the same size. 
It will only change depending on inputs of varying sizes. For example, an input
of 2 numbers will result in only 1 basic operation whereas an input of 10 numbers
will result in 9 basic operations. 

b) Computing n!

i) A natural size metric for inputs would be one integer.

ii) The basic operation of this algorithm is to multiply the input integer by an integer that is
one less than it. This process repeats until it reaches 1. The exception to this would be when the input
is 0 where in this case the output will just be 1. 

iii) The number of basic operations performed differs depending on the input integer. 

c) Finding the largest element in a list of n numbers

i) The natural size metric for this algorithm would be an array of numbers.

ii) The basic operation is to compare two numbers, and return/save the largest number of the 2. 

iii) The basic operation count will not change for different inputs of the same size. It will
change only when the input size differs. 

2. a) These both have the same order of growth (n^2)

b) The first function has a smaller order of growth than the second. n^2 compared to n^3

c) These both have the same order of growth (logarithmic)

d) The first function has a smaller order of growth (log(n) compared to log(n^2))

e) Both functions are a^n

f) Both functions are n!

3. 5lg(n+100)^10 , ln^2(n) , n^(1/3) , 0.001n^4 + 3n^3 + 1 , 3^n , 2^2n , (n-2)!

4. a) This algorithm computes the difference between the minimum and maximum values of a given array input

b) The basic operation is key comparison between integers in an array to find the maximum, and minumum 
elements. 

c) The algorithm performs the basic operation n times. Where n is the number of elements in the 
input array parameter. 

d) The efficiency class of this algorithm is linear.

e) Since this is a sorting algorithm, divide and conquer methods can be used to improve the efficiency from
linear to logarithmic. 



*****NOTE FOR THE TA: 

Questions 5, 6, and 7 were done using the provided Java file. It has been edited to fulfil the 
requirements for Questions 5, 6, and 7. I wrote my code using NetBeans 8.1, but I will also provide a .txt
file with the source code in case you would like to use another IDE.
