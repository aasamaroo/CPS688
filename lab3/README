Lab 3 README File: 

Submitted with this file is the code for CPS688 lab 3. For Q2, in the input
file I used the same values from the lab manual. 

The IDE that the code was written, and tested in was NetBeans 8.2. 

If you choose to test the code in another IDE, the source code can be
found in a seperate file "source_code.txt". The input file can be found in the cps688_lab3 subfolder.

If you have any questions, or concerns please email me at 
alexander.samaroo@ryerson.ca . 

Thank you.
